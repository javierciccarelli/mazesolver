# Maze Solving
## Challenge
To solve mazes.

## Input
The "source" maze will be a text file containing multiple lines, such as the following:
~~~~
#######
#     #
# # # #
# #E# #
# ### #
#S  # #
#######
~~~~
## Acceptance Criteria
The output should be written to standard-out and should show a path from the start "S" to the end "E". For example:

~~~~
#######
#***  #
#*#*# #
#*#E# #
#*### #
#S  # #
#######
~~~~
Walls are represented by the character "#", paths by a space, the start point by "S", the end point by "E" and the route should be marked using "*".

## Constraints
- Your application must run on Windows 7.
- You should only use libraries that are readily available on the Internet (e.g. Apache commons for Java).
- We wouldn't expect this to take more than a couple of hours.
- Don't use any existing maze solver you find on the internet.
## Optional
- Write any assumptions you've made.
- Show the shortest path.
