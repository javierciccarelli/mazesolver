- The maze is always a square (not tested otherwise, maybe it fails to print).
- Used simple recursive algorithm, could be made more efficient but had to adapt to time constraints. If the maze is big enough, it might overflow the stack.
- Corner cases not properly tested as per time constraints.
- Assumed there was no need to execute it from command line.
